# Backbone sessionStorage Adapter v0.1.1

This is simply a fork from the excellent [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage) by Jerome Gravel-Niquet and made compatible with window.sessionStorage as a drop-in replacement for Backbone.Sync() to handle saving to a sessionStorage database.

## Usage

Include Backbone.sessionStorage after having included Backbone.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.sessionStorage.js"></script>
```

Create your collections like so:

```javascript
window.SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  
  sessionStorage: new Backbone.SessionStorage("SomeCollection"), // Unique name within your app.
  
  // ... everything else is normal.
  
});
```
For furher usage instructions, see [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage).
